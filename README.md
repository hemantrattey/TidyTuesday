# Tidy Tuesday Implementation using Python

This repository is a python implementation of the very famous [***Tidy Tuesday*** repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) which contains a lot of datasets and aims at helping people get access to data to perform data analysis and visualizations. 

### Motivation

The motivation behind this repository comes from data screencasts done by [David Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/user/safe4democracy). In these videos, David looks at the data set and starts analyzing it live without previously seeing it. The Tidy Tuesday repo is built for the R ecosystem. But I wanted to practice my skills and wanted to implement these in Python using *Pandas* (for handling data) and *Plotnine* (for data visualization). 

***Plotnine*** is a visualization libary in Python based on the very famous R package *ggplot*. There are a lot of python libraries for visualization but I love how *ggplot* uses layers to build the final graphs and wanted to learn it so went ahead and started using *Plotnine*.
